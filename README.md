# MNIST-JS Demo Website

[![Deployment Status](https://github.com/wasinuddy/MNIST-JS/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/wasinuddy/MNIST-JS/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)


This repository contains a web application that demonstrates a deep learning model for handwritten digit recognition using TensorFlow.js and React.js. The model was trained with TensorFlow's Keras API on Python, and the resulting model was integrated into a React.js web application to provide a user-friendly interface for predicting handwritten digits.

## Demo

You can try out the live demo of the MNIST-JS web application by visiting [https://wasinuddy.github.io/MNIST-JS/](https://wasinuddy.github.io/MNIST-JS/).

## Features

- Handwritten digit recognition: Users can draw a digit on the canvas provided by the web application, and the deep learning model will predict the digit.
- TensorFlow.js integration: The trained model is deployed using TensorFlow.js, allowing it to run directly in the browser without the need for server-side computations.
- React.js user interface: The web application is built using React.js, providing a smooth and responsive user experience.
- Easy-to-use: The interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, making it accessible to users of all skill levels.
